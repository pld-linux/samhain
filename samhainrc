# SETUP for file system checking:
# 
# (i)   There are several policies, each has its own section. Put files
#       into the section for the appropriate policy (see below).
# (ii)  To each policy, you can assign a severity (further below).
# (iii) To each log facility, you can assign a threshold severity. Only
#       reports with at least the threshold severity will be logged
#       to the respective facility (even further below).

# You may enclose anything in a @HOSTNAME/@end bracket, as long as the

# You may have any number of @HOSTNAME/@end brackets.
# HOSTNAME should be the fully qualified 'official' name
